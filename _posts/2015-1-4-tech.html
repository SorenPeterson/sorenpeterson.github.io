        <p>The Internet is a magical and wonderful place where anything can happen. Except that it's not actually a place and you still can't use it to make forever-kittens. So maybe saying anything can happen is a little bit over the top. But it is pretty cool and everyday we are amazed by the ways in which people use it to change the world. It has allowed us to transform the ways in which we communicate, share, learn, interact and so much more. Without the Internet, we would be nowhere near where we are today.</p>
        <p>The internet is a series of [tubes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cZC67wXUTs) Ok. So it's not actually a series of tubes, but it's a good example of how the internet works. The internet is an absolutely massively collection of computers all connected together. These connections (or "tubes") carry information from one computer to another.</p>
        <p>Computers relay information to nearby computers which in turn relay it to other computers until it eventually reaches the intended destination. When you access a website your computer sends out a request to a computer that is potentially very far away. This request is passed between multiple stops before eventually reaching the computer that exists at the website address you typed in. It then processes your request and sends it back. It get's passed along the same path until it gets back to your computer and it is displayed on your screen.</p>
