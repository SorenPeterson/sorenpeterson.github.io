          <p>So far we have learned a lot about variables and methods. These are the most important tools for manipulating data. Using variables and methods we can write just about possible program. One of the newer programming concepts (but not that new) is object oriented programming. Object's are collections of variables and methods.</p>
          <p>We can create instances of these objects which are copies of the class template. Each of these instances will have it's own variables which can be set to any value and can only be accessed directly by that instance. They can also access the methods defined in the class template.</p>
          <p>Objects are good for representing complex ideas, such as real world objects. If we were to create a class template for a rectangle, what kind of variables and methods would we need? We can give our rectangle a width and a height. Those are the variables. We might want to know things about our rectangle as well such as the perimeter or area. These are the methods. Let's have a look at an example:</p>
<pre><code># Class Definition

class Rectangle
  def initialize(width, height)
    @width = width
    @height = height
  end

  def perimeter
    return width * 2 + height * 2
  end

  def area
    return width * height
  end
end</code></pre>
          <p>There is a bit of new syntax here. Firstly, the definition starts with the class keyword and the name for our class and ends with the end keyword. Next, there is an extra function called initialize. This function is called when we create a new instance of an object. This is the place to set up the object and get it ready for use. The third piece of new syntax is variables with the @ symbol. These variables are called instance variables. They can only be accessed by a particular instance of the class. Here, @width and @height are set in our initialization function. When we create instances of this class each will have their own @width and @height variables. Let's look at one more example and then I'll explain what's going on.</p>
<pre><code>#Usage:
bigrectangle = Rectangle.new(100, 50)
smallrectangle = Rectangle.new(10, 11)
bigrectangle.perimeter # 100 * 2 + 50 * 2 = 300
smallrectangle.perimeter # 10 * 2 + 11 * 2 = 42
bigrectangle.area # 100 * 50 = 5000
smallrectangle.area # 10 * 11 = 110</code></pre>
          <p>On the first two lines we are creating instances of the class. We have our variables smallrectangle and bigrectangle which each hold and instance of the class Rectangle. When we call the method new on Rectangle we pass in the width and height (respectively) of the rectangle we would like to represent. New is a class method inherited by all classes that creates a new object of that class. Before the object is returned, initialize is called on the new instance. Now both objects have their own copy of @width and @height. When we call perimeter and area on the objects they use the values set by our initialization function which were passed in.</p>
          <p>Classes can be used to represent ideas both physical and abstract. They have attributes and methods that can be performed upon them. They are extremely important to modern programming paradigms.</p>
