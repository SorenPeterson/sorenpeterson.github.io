        <center><h2>Cultural Blog Week 1</h2>
        <h6>11.2.14</h6></center>
        <p>The values and approaches that DBC takes really resonate with my views on learning. My favorite quote of the video was "Whatever happened was due to us." This really gives me a sense of being open to create, explore and expirement. Combine that with the communal learning environment and I can see the potential for a massively transformational experience. I am excited to immerse myself into this culture.</p>

        <p>I have mixed feelings about DBC and the next 18 or so weeks. On the one hand I feel very ready to start coding and developing. I have been programming for a few years now and I'm pretty comfortable with computers. But on the other hand I've never been in a professional environment. I have no idea if I have what it takes to be a valuable part of a development team. Deep down I know that I can learn but my nerves are still jittering thinking about it.</p>

        <p>This whole experience has been pretty crazy for me. Becoming a full-fledged software developer and immersing myself into software development culture is a dream come true for me. The thought that I could go from hobbyist to professional in a mere four months is astounding. I was dreading a college experience. aEarly into high school I was itching to get my hands dirty in the computer science world. When I learned about this program I immediately saw the potential. I want to squeeze out every bit of useful experience I can.</p>
