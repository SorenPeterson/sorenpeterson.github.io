        <p>In my science class in high school, I had quite a few conflicts with my teachers. We had disagreements on the way things were supposed to be done and as a result I was given poor grades. I thought this was unfair, and it frustrated. I felt disrespected as an intellectual and academic. I felt that my honest attempts to prove something true were disregarded because they weren't what was expected. I attempted to discuss it but it did not go over well. I think that I might have come off as aggressive and my teacher got defensive. If I could go back, I would have tried to come off as more discussive as opposed to accusatory. The reason I came off this way was because I was given a bad grade for what I deemed to be complete and in-depth work, regardless of whether or not it was correct. Looking back, I have learned that everyone is just a person. We all have feelings that are sensitive and we need to take care to tread lightly when stepping on each other as we must during the normal course of our lives.</p>
