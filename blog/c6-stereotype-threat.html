          <center><h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
          <h6>Dec.8.2014</h6></center>
          <p>I watched Claude M. Steeles talk on "Identity and Stereotype Threat." He was very on point and everything he said made a lot of sense. What he talks about is really interesting. He says that the identities we hold will affect the way we behave when we are in a position to become stereotyped by that identity. This is true whether or not we are actually being stereotyped. It is enough to just be in the situation. He says that these behaviors manifest most often when the situation is stressful.</p>
          <p>Being aware of your self can greatly impact how you are affected. If you can pay attention to the stereotypes that exist in the situation and more importantly quell the anxiety that forms around those stereotypes, then is it possible to move past them. This is often easier said than done. Sometimes we are not aware of the feelings we are having. Honing in on these feelings and anxieties is key to understanding why stereotypes affect behavior and how it can be prevented.</p>
