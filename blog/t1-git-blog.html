          <h3>Or how version control, git and GitHub make your life easier through tracking</h3>
          <h6>11.2.15</h6></center>
          <p>Version control systems are (or should be) the backbone of any great software project. They automate many tasks pertaining to the development of a piece of software. There are great benefits as both an individual and as a team. Version control system's allow the tracking of changes in code. With version control you can revert to a previous version if something becomes broken. We can also create separate instances of our code to work on new features. When the features are readyc the code can integrated back into the main project. If the code is hosted on a server it can be downloaded by any team member from anywhere. This simplifies the sharing of code and guarantees everyone is working off of the same copy.</p>

          <p>Git allows us to track changes to the code through commits. A commit is a saved version of our code accompanied by a message. The message should be descriptive and detail all of the changes that were made to the code. If we break something in our code and there is no hope in fixing it we can easily revert to a previous commit. In this way it acts like a checkpoint in a videogame.</p>

          <p>GitHub's main functionality is to store code. By storing code on GitHub we can centralize the main version of the code. This simplifies collaboration on projects and safeguards against loss of files. When two team members want to work on separate features in the code they can each create what is called a branch. A branch is a copy of the main code that is safe to work on and test. When they are finished with their features, their branches will be merged with the main version of the code, hosted on GitHub.</p>
