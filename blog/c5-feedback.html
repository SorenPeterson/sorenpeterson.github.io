        <p>I like pairing with others to solve challenges. To me, it is both more challenging and rewarding. I am forced to explain my thought processes which helps me think through them in a logical and ordered manner. You get a really good sense of what's going on in the code because you need to know how to talk about it with another person. It was really fun when it works as expected. After putting in the time to pseudocode and think about the problem it was exciting to see the result. When pairing you need to give in to the fact that we all are separate people who know different things. I have been programming for four years but every person who I paired with taught me something new. That is super inspiring to me.</p>
        <p>Receiving feedback is really helpful. It allows me to gauge where I am personally and what parts of my skills need work. I like reading the feedback I get. A few of my pairs have told me to slow down. Sometimes I skip ahead in my head and I don't explain my process. I will be more attentive to this in future pairing sessions. Writing feedback feels pretty comfortable. The only thing that is hard is picking the right words. Sometimes ideas don't translate well over text.</p>
