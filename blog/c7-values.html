        <p>There are a lot of things that I find satisfying in life. Biking, making friends, peeling off stickers and other. But the best most are those filled with excitement, independence, challenge and inspiration. These are a few of the things that really drive me every day to keep at it and never give up. They empower to learn things about myself that I didn't even know existed. I try to let these values lead me in my daily life as best I can.</p>
        <p>Independence is very important to me. Don't get me wrong, I am happy to ask for and accept helpf. But there is satisfaction in knowing that you can achieve something on your own. I think that asking for and accepting support is an important part of being and becoming independent. Ten minutes of someone else's time might save you hours of frustration and confusion. Having that knowledge now makes you independent and capable on your own. Being independent is important to me because it's a way of proving my own self-validation, which is important for everyone's well-being.</p>
