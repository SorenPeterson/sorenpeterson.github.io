      <h2>Education</h2>
      <h3>Dev Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>Learned practical software design. I built strong foundations in Object Oriented and Model View Controller design. I learned about agile development and project workflow. We worked almost exclusively either in teams or pairs. As such I have experience working well with others.</p>
      <h3>Great River School</h3>
      <p>GRS is a Montessori high school. I learned about the importance of taking care of your community. This transferred into a consciousness of the people around me. I learned how to care for the people I am working with, and I find that to be an invaluable skill.</p>
